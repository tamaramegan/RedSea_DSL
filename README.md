## Diel vertical migration promotes prokaryotic diversity in the Red Sea mesopelagic
This repository contains the code base to reproduce the main figures presented in *Huete-Stauffer et al. Diel vertical migration promotes prokaryotic diversity in the Red Sea mesopelagic.*

#### How to use this repository
- The code is written in R (version 3.6.1) within RStudio (1.2.5019). No other versions have been tested
- Inside the folder 'Figures_main' there is a script per figure (eg: Huete-Stauffer_Fig2.R). You can open that script inside RStudio and use the button 'Source' to run the script entirely and output the figure to terminal. You van also run it manually if you are interested in the intermediate steps of each figure.
- The original data (sequences with taxonomy and metadata) are available for download at https://zenodo.org/record/5816123. You don't need to doenload these files before running the scripts, it is integrated inside each script.
